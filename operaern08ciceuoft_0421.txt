THE

REGENT’S CLASSICS.

POCKET EDITIONS.

 

 

Tun Publishers of this Collection flatter themselves
that they render an acceptable and important service
to the lovers of ancient Literature, in providing for
them, at a moderate price, and in a small compass,
, a neat, uniform, and complete Library of the Latin
Classics, equal, in typographio Elegance and Accura-
cy, to the celebrated Elzevir Editions‚ and superior to
them in the Purity of the Text—corrected and amend-

' the industry and sagacity of learned Critics in different
countries‚ from a review of all the existing Editions,

, with the Collation of ancient Manuscripts, which had

The aggregate productions of those Critics’ se·
parate labors constitute the destined collection,
which, therefore, may with justice be deemed as per-
fect and complete a Bady ffLatinity, as can reason-
ably be expected from any sources yet known to the
Literary world ; the Text of each Author being copied
from that particular Edition, whether foreign or do-
mestic, which stands highest in the estimation of the
Literati ; and the impression being conducted under
the vigilant inspection of responsible Editors, duly
qualified for the task. With
